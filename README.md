this started when i wanted to know how screensavers worked after i downloaded the minecraft screen saver and realized if you rename it to a .exe it still worked

anyways i think while i was at school or something i found this random website (https://www.wischik.com/scr/holsavers.html) and downloaded the example zip and used minscr.cpp as a learning thing yk

i already had a project for Direct3D so i added the header and modified it alot (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfbWt1BnPIo&list=PLqCJpWy5Fohd3S7ICFXwUomYW0Wv67pDD&index=17&pp=iAQB)

also at some point i will probably add Direct3D and DXGI + Direct2D to JBS3 but it would probably take a while and i cannot get stuck making JBS3 again

(lets hope this project actually works when you download it)
